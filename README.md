# Affect-Recognition-Using-Physiological-Signals
The project that uses data like heart rate, skin conductance, and brain activity to detect human emotions. By applying machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and KNN, the project aims to classify emotional states, enabling applications in mental health monitoring and human-computer interaction.
